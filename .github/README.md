# DeimosClient
A well structured, 1.21.1 Minecraft utility client/cheat. <br> Free to use, distribute, and modify under the BSD-2 Clause. 
# How do I use this client?
If you are tech savvy, and/or paranoid, you can open IntelliJ and build the source from there using gradle and the tools IntellJ provides. 
<br> Otherwise, versions **SHOULD** be in the releases tab. Otherwise just build it. 
# Why use this client? 
Who knows? I *may* make the project a paid system in the future. Otherwise, use it or don't. 
<br> It has better GrimAC utilities than meteor, but you should decide whether or not to use it. Not me persuading you.
